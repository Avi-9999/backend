Create an ultra-realistic 8-second cinematic video of a jacked, lean Indian male rider with a sharp jawline and long flowing hair, wearing a vibrant AGV helmet with cool, colorful graphics. He is dressed in an olive cargo pant, a tight pink compression T-shirt that flutters naturally in the wind, and white Nike sneakers. The rider is speeding on a red and black BMW S1000RR superbike on an open highway under daylight. The video begins with a dramatic front-facing medium close-up shot capturing the upper body and helmet as he rides, emphasizing his muscular frame and the airflow over his shirt. The camera then cuts to a tight closeup of his gloved hands gripping the handlebar and twisting the throttle, showing tension in his forearms. This transitions into a low-angle macro shot of his foot shifting gears with precision, capturing the Nike sneaker and the metallic glint of the gear lever. As the engine roars louder, the scene shifts to an over-the-shoulder tracking shot from behind the rider, showcasing the road zooming past and the movement of his shirt and hair in the wind. The camera then swings to a dynamic side panning view of the rider in full profile, showing the aggressive lean of his body and the S1000RR cutting through the air at high speed. Finally, the video ends with a low rear-wheel angle shot, close to the ground, where the spinning tire, vibrating exhaust, and road blur create a sense of raw motion and power. The engine sound increases naturally throughout the sequence, matching the rider's acceleration. All elements—human anatomy, bike movement, shadows, airflow, clothing dynamics, and the highway environment—should appear photorealistic with smooth, believable motion
